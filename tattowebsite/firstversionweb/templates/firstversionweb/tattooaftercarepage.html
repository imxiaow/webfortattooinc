		<h1>Dermatologists agree that anyone who gets a tattoo also needs instructions on how to take care of it to prevent infections and serious complications.</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not scratch your tattoo. It will itch during the healing process. This process can last up to two weeks. Do not swim, soak in a hot tub, or take a bath for two weeks after getting your tattoo. Also, avoid tanning. </li>
			<li> Depending on the placement, the size, and an individualâ€™s hygiene, and daily activities, healing is different for everyone. </li>
			<li>You should expect your new tattoo to be red, irritated, swollen, and possibly bruised. These are normal reactions to the tattoo area. If swelling or bruising occurs, this could last for up to a week, especially if tattooed in a sensitive area such as the feet.</li>
		</ul>
